Package: sqlBatchInsertR
Title: SQL DML Support for RODBC
Description: sqlBatchInsertR is built on top of the RODBC package and aims 
    to extend its functionality. It provides an efficient way of inserting 
    a data frame into a database table and handling SQL DML statements. The 
    function sqlBatchInsert sends batches of parameterized INSERT statements 
    to a database in a transaction. The function sqlTransaction prompts a 
    user to commit or rollback a SQL DML statement. It is made minimal and 
    depends only on the RODBC package.
